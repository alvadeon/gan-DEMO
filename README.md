# GAN Project README

## Overview
This project involves training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images. The GAN architecture includes a generator and a discriminator that are trained simultaneously. The generator creates fake images, while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity. The goal is to improve the generator to the point where it can produce realistic images indistinguishable from real ones.

## Features
- Train a GAN model on a specified dataset.
- Generate images using the trained GAN model.
- Evaluate the performance of the GAN model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- (Add any other specific libraries or dependencies required for your project)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gan-project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd gan-project
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
### Training the GAN
1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the training script:
    ```
    python train.py --dataset data/your_dataset --epochs 100 --batch_size 64
    ```
    - `--dataset`: Path to your dataset.
    - `--epochs`: Number of training epochs.
    - `--batch_size`: Size of the training batch.

### Generating Images
1. After training, use the trained model to generate images:
    ```
    python generate.py --model checkpoint/model.pth --output_dir generated_images --num_images 10
    ```
    - `--model`: Path to the trained model checkpoint.
    - `--output_dir`: Directory to save the generated images.
    - `--num_images`: N
